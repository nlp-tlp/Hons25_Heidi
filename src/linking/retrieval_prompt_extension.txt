### Entity candidates

Here are some already fuzzy matched entities from the knowledge base, from some mentions in the question. Pick which ones to use, as they are not always relevant. There may be a single match that is best, but if multiple are plausible given the query then make sure to cover all of the plausible.

The user asking the question may be mistaken about the right type, in which case it may be helpful to retrieve for another type that contains a very similar name. The user may also link together names that should be split across multiple entity types, so check combinations of entities that make sense to be called that name if together.
