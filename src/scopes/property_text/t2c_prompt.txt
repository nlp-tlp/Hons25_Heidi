### Task

Convert natural language questions into Cypher queries, for execution over a Neo4j graph that has the given schema below. Ensure that more than enough is retrieved - Include any information that might be useful to generate a response.

### Neo4j graph schema

{schema}

### Question to convert

{question}

### Rules

1. Output the Cypher query with no markdown wrapping such that it can be directly executed.
2. Do not return node objects. Return entity properties or aggregation aliases.
3. All exact text matches must pay attention to case.
4. This is a FMEA dataset. Provide all system/ component names when identifying specific failure modes.

### Few-shot examples

Question: What is the average RPN for failure modes in the Power Supply subsystem?
Cypher:
MATCH (subsystem:Subsystem)<-[:PART_OF]-(component:Component)<-[:PART_OF]-(subcomponent:SubComponent)<-[:FOR_PART]-(failuremode:FailureMode)
WHERE subsystem.name = 'Power Supply'
RETURN subsystem.name, component.name, subcomponent.name, AVG(failuremode.rpn), COUNT(failuremode.rpn)
