### Task

Convert natural language questions into Cypher queries, for execution over a Neo4j graph that has the given schema below. Ensure that more than enough is retrieved - Include any information that might be useful to generate a response.

### Neo4j graph schema

{schema}

### Question to convert

{question}

### Extended Cypher functions

Aside from existing Cypher functions and syntax, make use the additional function below where necessary. Any text property matches must be done with this function in WHERE clauses, instead of typical exact matches.

* IS_SEMANTIC_MATCH(text_property, "text_to_match")

### Rules

1. Output the Cypher query with no markdown wrapping such that it can be directly executed.
2. Do not return node objects. Return entity properties or aggregation aliases.
3. Any text property matches must be done with the above extended function.
4. Only use the text matching functions in WHERE clauses, and not others like CASE clauses.
5. This is a FMEA dataset. Provide all system/ component names when identifying specific failure modes.

### Few-shot examples

Question: What is the average RPN for failure modes in the power supply?
Cypher:
MATCH (subsystem:Subsystem)<-[:PART_OF]-(component:Component)<-[:PART_OF]-(subcomponent:SubComponent)<-[:FOR_PART]-(failuremode:FailureMode)
WHERE IS_SEMANTIC_MATCH(subcomponent.name, 'power supply')
RETURN subsystem.name, component.name, subcomponent.name, AVG(failuremode.rpn), COUNT(failuremode.rpn)

Question: What are the failure modes in the Communication subsystem, which have recommended actions involving the prevention of contamination?
Cypher:
MATCH (subsystem:Subsystem)<-[:PART_OF]-(component:Component)<-[:PART_OF]-(subcomponent:SubComponent)<-[:FOR_PART]-(failuremode:FailureMode)-[:HAS_ACTION]->(recommendedaction:RecommendedAction)
WHERE IS_SEMANTIC_MATCH(subsystem.name, 'communication')
    AND IS_SEMANTIC_MATCH(recommendedaction.description, 'prevention of contamination')
RETURN subsystem.name, component.name, subcomponent.name, failuremode.description, recommendedaction.description
