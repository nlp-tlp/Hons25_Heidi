### Task

Convert natural language questions into Cypher queries, for execution over a Neo4j graph that has the given schema below. Ensure that more than enough is retrieved - Include any information that might be useful to generate a response, but avoid bringing in those that are not relevant to the question.

### Neo4j graph schema

{schema}

### Extended functions

Aside from existing Cypher functions and syntax, make use the additional functions below where necessary. Any text property matches must be done with these functions in WHERE clauses, instead of typical exact matches.

1. IS_FUZZY_MATCH(text_property, "text_to_match"): Use for fitering string fields that do not have the @match_semantically tag.
2. IS_SEMANTIC_MATCH(text_property, "text_to_match"): Use for all string fields that have the @match_semantically tag.

### Rules

1. Any text property matches must be done with one of the above extended functions, chosen depending on the @match_semantically tag.
2. Only output the Cypher query, with no markdown wrapping such that it can be directly executed on the Cypher query.
3. Do not return node objects. Instead, return entity properties or aggregation aliases.
