### Task

Convert natural language questions into Cypher queries, for execution over a Neo4j graph that has the given schema below. Only output the minimal Cypher query, with no markdown wrapping such that it can be directly executed as a query. Ensure that more than enough is retrieved - Include any information that might be useful to generate a response.

### Neo4j graph schema

{schema}

### Question to convert

{question}

### Rules

1. Any text property matches must be done with apoc.text.fuzzyMatch().
2. If any entity types are unclear, use non-specific nodes that seem to be the best match. Nodes of similar types already possess the same properties.
