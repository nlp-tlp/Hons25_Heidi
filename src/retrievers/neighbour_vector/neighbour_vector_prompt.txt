### Task

Decompose natural language questions into a sequence of retrieval steps, to traverse and add nodes from an existing knowledge graph. There are two types of retrieval steps:
* **"query"** - Does a vector search over all the text descriptions in the knowledge graph, and adds the top-K most similar nodes to a final pool of candidates. This new top-K is also set as an intermediate set of nodes.
* **"search"** - Does a vector search over all the neighbours of an intermediate set of nodes, and adds them to both the final pool of candidates and the intermediate set of nodes.

### Output format

Output in the following JSON format exactly:
{{
    "steps": [
        {{"type": "query", "query": "<phrase>"}},
        {{"type": "search", "search": "<phrase>"}},
        ...
    ],
    "reasoning": "<your thought process here>"
}}

### Graph schema

Here is the graph schema being used. The types of entities and their respective properties may be useful. Making use of this, ignore any names in the question that is simply referring to an entity or property type. Do not add these into your final list of phrases to query/search for.

{schema}
