### Task

Decompose natural language questions into a sequence of retrieval steps, to traverse and add nodes from an existing knowledge graph. There are two types of retrieval steps:
* **"query"** - Does a vector search over all the text descriptions in the knowledge graph, and adds the top-K most similar nodes to a final pool of candidates. This new top-K is also set as an intermediate set of nodes.
* **"search"** - Does a vector search over all the neighbours of an intermediate set of nodes, and adds them to both the final pool of candidates and the intermediate set of nodes.

### Output format

Output in the following JSON format exactly:
{{
    "steps": [
        {{"type": "query", "query": "<phrase>"}},
        {{"type": "search", "search": "<phrase>"}},
        ...
    ],
    "reasoning": "<your thought process here>"
}}
