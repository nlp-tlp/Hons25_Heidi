### Task

You are helping with output normalization in an evaluation pipeline. Your task is to determine whether different output aliases refer to the same concept.

You will be given a list of gold-standard output aliases and a list of candidate aliases. For each candidate, indicate which gold-standard alias it is equivalent to, or "none" if no match exists. Aliases may be phrased differently, but are equivalent so long as they refer to the same concept.

### Gold-standard aliases

{gold_aliases}

### Candidate aliases

{candidate_aliases}

## Output format example (JSON):

Return as a JSON object, with each candidate alias as keys, and the gold alias/ "none" as values.

For example:
{{
  "candidate_alias": "gold_alias",
  "candidate_alias_2": "gold_alias_2",
  "candidate_alias_3": "none",
  ...
}}
